ConditionalPlacement
====================

The third project for iOS pre-course using conditionals.

### Step 1: Get the project started on your computer and on GitHub
- *For more detailed instructions see the first [project](https://github.com/DevMountain/AGoodStart.git)*
- *'**Step 1**' is something we will do hundreds of times in class. You need to be able to do it quickly and without running into issues so it doesn't slow class down.*
- Either create a project locally and push to GitHub
- Or fork this project and clone it to your computer

### Step 2: Compare values and place in buckets
- Declare two integers (karl and leonard) 
- Set the value of karl to 10 and leonard to 7
- Declare two more integers (karlPlace and leonardPlace)

### Step 3: Use a Ternary Operator to set values
- You need to set those integers in the same line you create them using a ternary operator
  - Example: ``` variablePlace = variable > 7 ? 1 : 2 ```
  - That code checks if joshua is greater than 7 and if it is it sets joshuaPlace to 1 otherwise it sets it to 2
- If karl is > 7 it should be set to 1 otherwise it should be set to 2
- If leonard is > 7 leonardPlace should be set to 1 otherwise it should be set to 2

### Step 4: Print out the placements
- Check if leonardPlace and karlPlace are both equal to 1
  - If true log "Both teachers are placed 1"
- If they are not both 1 check if karlPlace is equal to 1
  - If true log "Karl is placed 1 and Leonard is placed 2"
- If karlPlace is not equal to 1 check if leonardPlace is equal to 1
  - If true log "Leonard is placed 1 and Karl is placed 2"
- If leonardPlace is not equal to 1
  - If that's false as well, log "Karl and Leonard are placed 2" 

### Step 5: Check your work
- Feel free to play with the scores of each name and validate that your placement check work correctly
